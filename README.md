# Simple Gallery App

## Overwiev

Gallery App is a simple React Native application that leverages the Unsplash API to fetch images. The state management is handled efficiently with Redux Toolkit, making it easy to manage the app's state. 
This app is designed to showcase a gallery of images with details such as image previews, author information, and descriptions.
